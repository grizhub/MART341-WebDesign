What is a directory, and what is its relationship to files?
It is like a folder or box to put files in.

How are VCS useful?
One of the usefulness is open source and everyone can use it for free.

Do you have a favorite artistic medium? Why is it your favorite?
I like a website because I think it is designed to ensure that information reaches the audience. 
To be honest, I don't like some artistic medium such as paintings and photographs because they are sometimes just the maker's selfishness without intention to share or convey information to the audience.
